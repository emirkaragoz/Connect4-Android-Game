Connect4 game is a Android Application. There are two types of game modes, player versus player and player versus computer. The size of the game board can be adjusted between 5 and 40 according to the user's request. There is a time mode option (minimum 5 maximum 999 seconds). For starting the game, you must choose a game type, enter a board size and if time mode is on enter a time amount. You can termination the game and return to the menu by pressing the menu button at the top left of the game screen. The part in the top center of the game screen is the time counter (if time mode off there is no time counter). If you do not move within the time you chosen, a random move will be made and the move order will pass to the other player (or computer).
